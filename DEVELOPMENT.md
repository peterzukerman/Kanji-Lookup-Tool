APR 18:

Created initial project. Added openFrameworks gui. Created cpp program to convert CSV to dictionary for parsing. Uploaded databases to github. Starting Gui work.

APR 24:

CSV reader works. Loads example sentences with jpn and eng meaning, and japanese reading correctly. Reformated the example sentence database to be tab delimited instead of comma delimited.

APR 25:

XML reader works and is optimized for use outside of the program (through method calls for specific character.) CSV reader now parses into a HashMap sorted by character, with each character's values being a vector of 2d arrays containing the example sentences.

APR 26

Both readers work. Began work on GUI.
